# 3D Printable Models for Acoustic Levitator

This directory contains STL files for 3D printing the components of the acoustic levitator.

## Available Models

### Single-Axis Levitator Components

- `top_platform.stl` - Top platform for mounting 9 transmitters
- `bottom_platform.stl` - Bottom platform for mounting 9 transmitters
- `support_structure.stl` - Adjustable support structure to maintain proper spacing
- `fine_adjustment_mechanism.stl` - Mechanism for precise control of platform spacing

### Three-Axis Levitator Components (Coming Soon)

- `x_axis_platform.stl` - Front and back platforms
- `y_axis_platform.stl` - Left and right platforms
- `z_axis_platform.stl` - Top and bottom platforms
- `central_support.stl` - Support structure for all six platforms

## Printing Recommendations

- **Material**: PLA or PETG
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm
- **Infill**: 20-25%
- **Supports**: Required for some components (see individual model notes)
- **Orientation**: Print platforms with the mounting surface facing upward

## Assembly Notes

Refer to the [Assembly Guide](../documentation/assembly_guide.md) for detailed instructions on how to assemble the 3D printed components with the electronic parts.

## Customization

These models can be modified using CAD software. The original design files (.f3d, .step) will be provided upon request.
